# Introduction

An modular and extensible bot for the Discord server associated with the YouTube channel Study Vibes. Written in Python 3 using `discord.py`.

## Requirements

Python 3 and discord.py are definitely required. Depending on which features of the bot you wish to use several more Python packages may be required. In most cases, just installing everything in Pipfile won't hurt.
